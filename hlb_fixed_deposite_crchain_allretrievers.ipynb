      "Answer: Based on the information provided, if you invest RM 50,000 in a 12-month Fixed Deposit with Hong Leong Bank, you will earn an interest rate of 2.50% per annum. To calculate the total amount that can be withdrawn at the end of the 12-month term, you can use the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "Total Amount = Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Interest Rate x Time)\n",
      "\n",
      "Total Amount = RM 50,000 + (RM 50,000 x 2.50% x 1 year)\n",
